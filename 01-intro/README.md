Regarding intro in the LLM_Zoomcamp:
I recently learned about Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). 
For a homework project, I implemented a solution using Elasticsearch to fetch documents based on user questions. 
By integrating Elasticsearch, I was able to retrieve relevant information quickly and accurately. 
This approach enhanced the LLM's responses by providing contextually appropriate data from the retrieved documents. 
The experience was insightful and demonstrated the power of combining advanced search techniques with LLMs.
Thank you, Zoomcamp!
